- unimpaired
	-  ] or [ takes you to next or previous something
	- % jumps between next last bracket (}]or
	- [[ or ]] jump to references of the variable lsp 
	- `c`, `]c`, `[f`, `]f`, `[m`, and `]m` jump to previous/next function/method/class def
	- ]a next arg
	- `[i` and `]i` jump to end of indentation level
- Text objects mini.ai
	-  Type “da” to see list of all text objects
	- B is any bracket q is any “‘’
	- G is whole file
	- c class, f function or method, o block loop or coditional, t html tag, i indentation level
	- H is git hunk
	- cin{ cut inside next {}, can use l for last
	- cS cut seek, puts pairs of tags around various things i can choose from
	- cR<characters> seekers to characters and shows pairs of tags around that position
	- cr<chars>iw seek to chars and cut inner word
	- % jumps to closest bracket 
	- <c-space> inc treesitter selection <bs> decrease it 
- Seek flash.vim
	- s<chars> seem to chars
	- nvim-spider for jumping by camel case words 
- Screen movement
	- zt move current line to top
	- zb move line to bottom
	- zz move line to middle

- git
  - <leader>gb - git blame
- indent

To do that, use `gr` to show the references in a picker as usual. Then use `Control-t` to show each of the matches in the Trouble window. Now you can use `]q` and `[q` to jump
